# Contrast Ratio

For visually impaired people, it is important to have a good contrast ratio of texts, logotypes and images on a website.
Contrast Ratio can be easily checked with a Lighthouse check.

### Best practice

* [Understanding Contrast Minimum](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)

### Check

* Is text easily readable and big enough to read? Does it clearly separate itself from the background of the website?
* Is the logo well-placed? (e.g. navbar where the background colour supports the logotype)
