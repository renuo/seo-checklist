# Meta description
Your webpage's meta description is an HTML tag that is intended to provide a short and accurate summary of your page. Search engines use meta descriptions to help identify the page's topic - they may also use meta descriptions by displaying them directly in search engine results. Accurate and inviting meta descriptions can help boost both your search engine rankings and a user's likelihood of clicking through to your page.

### Best practice
* Use an individual meta description per page (160 characters) in target language.
