# Page title
A page or meta title is an HTML tag that defines the title of a page. This tag displays a page title in search engine results, at the top of a user's browser, and also when a page is bookmarked in a list of favorites. A concise, descriptive title tag that accurately reflects your page's topic is important for ranking well in search engines.

### Best practice
* Use a unique, descriptive title per page (65 characters) in target language.
* Use the page's keyword in the title tag.
