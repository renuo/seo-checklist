# Page title

A document title is an HTML tag that defines the title of a page.
This tag displays a page title in search engine results, at the top of a user's browser, and also when a page is bookmarked in a list of favorites.
The contents of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization and should be chosen carefully.
Hence, a concise, meaningful and descriptive title tag that accurately reflects your page's topic is important for ranking well in search engines.

A page title ideally identifies the page uniquely. This usually results in constructs like

> MyWebsite - About Us
> MyWebsite - Features

```
<head>
 <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
```

## Best practice

Some rules to follow when chosing a page title:

> * Avoid one- or two-word titles. Use a descriptive phrase, or a term-definition pairing for glossary or reference-style pages.
> * Search engines typically display about the first 55–60 characters of a page title. Text beyond that may be lost, so try not to have titles longer than that. If you must use a longer title, make sure the important parts come earlier and that nothing critical is in the part of the title that is likely to be dropped.
> * Don't use "keyword blobs." If your title is just a list of words, algorithms often reduce your page's position in the search results.
> * Try to make sure your titles are as unique as possible within your own site. Duplicate—or near-duplicate—titles can contribute to inaccurate search results.

Gnerally valid:

* Use a unique, descriptive title per page (65 characters) in target language.
* Use the page's keyword in the title tag.
