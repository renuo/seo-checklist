# Site loading speed

Page speed is an important factor in search engine rankings and overall site success. Pages that take longer than 5 seconds to load can lose up to 50% of users. Faster webpages result in higher traffic, better conversions and increased sales over slower loading pages.

Follow the other best practices to improve the speed (Optimise images. Enable compression. Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Remove render-blocking JavaScript. etc.)
