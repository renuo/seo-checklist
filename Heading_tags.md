# Heading tags

HTML heading tags are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

Your webpage should be using at least one H1 and one H2 HTML header tag. Header tags are not visible to users, but help clarify and support the overall theme or purpose of your page to search engines.

The H1 tag represents the most important heading, e.g., the title of the page or blog post.
The H2 tag represents the second most important headings on the webpages, e.g., the subheadings.

## Code example

```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

## Best practice

* Use one, individual H1 on every page (visible) containing the main keyword.
* Use an individual H2, H3 and H4 tag on every page.
* Too many heading tags on a page can make it hard for users and search engines to scan the content and determine where one topic ends and another begins.
