# Meta description

Your webpage's meta description is an HTML tag that is intended to provide a short and accurate summary of your page. Search engines use meta descriptions to help identify the page's topic - they may also use meta descriptions by displaying them directly in search engine results. Accurate and inviting meta descriptions can help boost both your search engine rankings and a user's likelihood of clicking through to your page.

### Code example

```
<head>
 <meta name="description" content="This is the description of this page and its content.">
</head>
```

### Best practice

* Use an individual meta description for every page in target language.
* Use meta description with up to 150 characters and keep in mind that on mobile devices only 120 characters are displayed.
