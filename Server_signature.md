# Server signature
A server signature is the public identity of your web server and contains sensitive information that could be used to exploit any known vulnerability. Turning your server signature OFF is considered a good security practice to avoid disclosure of what software versions you are running.

### Best practice
* Check if your server signature ist turned off with [this](https://seositecheckup.com/tools/server-signature-test) or [this](http://security.firewallmonitor.org) tool.
