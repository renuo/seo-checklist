# Keep a simple URL structure

While it's important for to represent URLs in a user-friendly way (see [SEO friendly URLs](seo-friendly-urls.md) it's also
important to be aware what your URL structure means for the content. For example filters can produce duplicated content.

## Best practices

* Block robots-access to dynamically created search results (in [robots-txt.md](robots-txt.md) or with `nofollow`).

## Check

* Do you build content dynamically based on query parameters (e.g. documents)?
