# JavaScript minification
External JavaScript files must be minified. Minified files reduce page size and overall load time.

### Best practice
* Minimize external JavaScript files with an online JS minifier such as [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/), [Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) or [JSMin](https://www.crockford.com/jsmin.html).

### Check
* Google lighthouse can identify issues with Javascript minification
