# Descriptive links

Link descriptions, which are the clickable words in links, help users and search engines better understand your content.

### Code example

```
<a href="https://www.example.com/webpage.html">Keyword in Anchor Text</a>
```

### Best practice

* Use descriptive links (e.g. "Today's menu" instead of "More").
* View this article about it in the [Google Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/descriptive-link-text).
