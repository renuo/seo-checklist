# Image caching

Your page should use image expire tags, which specify a future expiration date for your images. Users browsers will see this tag and cache the image in their browser until the specified date (so that it does not keep re-fetching the unchanged image from your server). This speeds up your site the next time returning visitors arrive at your site and require the same image.
