# Heading tags
Your webpage should be using at least a H1 and a H2 HTML header tag. Header tags are not visible to users, but help clarify and support the overall theme or purpose of your page to search engines. The H1 tag represents the most important heading, e.g., the title of the page or blog post. The H2 tag represents the second most important headings on the webpages, e.g., the subheadings.

### Best practice
* Use one, individual H1 on every page (visible) containing the main keyword.
* Use an individual H2, H3 and H4 tag on every page.
