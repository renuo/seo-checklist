# Keywords

## Best practice

* Use max. 1 Keyword per page.
* Donâ€™t use any meta keywords, as they are not used by google anymore and give competitors data about the keywords you are targeting, see: [Webmaster Central Blog](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html).
* Do not stuff keywords or unnatural phrasing - these times are long gone.

## Keyword density

* Check your keyword density: [Keyword density analysis tool](https://imninjas.com/seo-tools/keyword-density/).
* Make sure you also incorporperate keywords that are relevant to that specific topic.
