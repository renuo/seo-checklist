# Keywords

## Best practice

* Use max. 1 Keyword per page.
* Donâ€™t use any meta keywords, as they are not used by google anymore and give competitors data about the keywords you are targeting, see: [Webmaster Central Blog](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html).
* Do not stuff keywords or unnatural phrasing - these times are long gone.

## Keyword density

* Check your keyword density: [Keyword density analysis tool](https://imninjas.com/seo-tools/keyword-density/).
* Make sure you also incorporperate keywords that are relevant to that specific topic.

# Lazy loading

Lazy loading is a technique that defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time. Instead, these non-critical resources are loaded at the moment of need.

## Best practice

* Lazy Load image `<img loading=lazy>`
* Lazy Load fonts `<link remil="preload">`
