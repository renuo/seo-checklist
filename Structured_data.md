# Structured data

Search engines use HTML microdata specifications (or structured data markups) to better understand the content of a site and create rich snippets in search results (which helps increase click-through rate to a site).

## Best practice

* View Google's guide for getting started with microdata: [How to structure data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).
* Check the [Google Search Gallery](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery) for structured data you might want to use.
* Check this [starter guide](https://moz.com/learn/seo/schema-structured-data).
* Find here the [schema hierarchy](https://schema.org/docs/full.html) and here the [schema documentation](https://schema.org/docs/documents.html).
* Test your structured data with this [testing tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/).
