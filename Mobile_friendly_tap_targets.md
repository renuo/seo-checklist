# Mobile-friendly tap targets

Tap targets are the areas of a web page that users on touch devices can interact with. Buttons, links, and form elements all have tap targets.
Many search engines rank pages based on how mobile-friendly they are. Making sure tap targets are big enough and far enough apart from each other makes your page more mobile-friendly and accessible.

## Best practice

* Targets should be bigger than 48px x 48px and further apart than 8px. See more at <https://web.dev/tap-targets/>
