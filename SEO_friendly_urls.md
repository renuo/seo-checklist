# SEO friendly URLs
In order for URLs and links to be SEO friendly, they should contain keywords relevant to the page's topic, and contain no spaces, underscores or other characters. 
You should avoid the use of parameters when possible, as they make URLs less inviting for users to click or share. 
Search engines's suggestions for URL structure specify using hyphens or dashes (-) rather than underscores (_). 
Unlike underscores, search engines treat hyphens as separators between words in a URL.

### Best practice
* Provide clean URLs without fragment identifiers (# or #!).
* Use hyphens as word separators.
* Avoid URLs with Umlaute. Use ae, oe, ue, etc. instead, see: [Search Console Support](https://support.google.com/webmasters/forum/AAAA2Jdx3sUn_XASERbfzw/?hl=en&gpf=%23!msg%2Fwebmasters%2Fn_XASERbfzw%2FKt1fG7jKCQAJ&msgid=Kt1fG7jKCQAJ).
* Use keywords in the URL in the target language.
* When possible, place content on the same subdomain to preserve authority. (Recommended: https://example.com/blog, less ideal: https://blog.example.com)
