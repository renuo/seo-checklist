# Broken links
Your website shouldn't have any broken or dead links. Broken links negatively impact the user experience and damage your website's overall ranking with search engines.

### Best practice
Scan your website regularly to locate both broken internal links (pointing within your website) and external broken links (pointing outside of your website). Use [Broken Link Check](https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com), [Dr Link Check](https://www.drlinkcheck.com) or [Dead Link Checker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com).
