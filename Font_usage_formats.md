# Font usage & formats
It is important to keep as much website content in readable text format (instead of graphic images of desired fonts) for good SEO and to maintain good search engine rankings.
Don't include too many different fonts and variants, as this will negatively impact the site load performance. Include only what is actually used and needed.

### Best practice
Use one of these main font formats: 
* TrueType Font (TTF, most common)
* Web Open Font Format (WOFF, specifically designed for use on webpages)
* WOFF2 (with improved compressing)
* Embedded OpenType (EOT, supported only by IE)

Each font family should be provided in all of these formats, so that the browser can choose the most optimised version supported.
