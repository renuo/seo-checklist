Hi folks!

As developers, we might not think about SEO right away, while developing a new project. But to create a great website that performs well and can be found by possible users, good SEO is always essential.

This checklist is free for you to use and is meant as a reference for all the aspects that should be checked before the go-live of a project. We suggest reading this once before starting a new project, to keep yourself up-to-date, and then again before the go-live, to double check and verify that all the points that matter are respected.

We update this checklist regularly. Nevertheless, if you find any missing points let us know or commit them directly yourself.

Together we create the best SEO checklist on GitHub!
