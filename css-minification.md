# CSS minification
All CSS files used in your page must be minified. Minified files reduce page size and overall load time.

### Best practice
* Minimize external CSS files with an online CSS minifier such as [YUI Compressor](https://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/) or [cssmin.js](https://www.phpied.com/cssmin-js/).
