# Google Maps

The visibility of a website in the search results can be increased if it also appears in the search engine map.
So if the website belongs to a business or other location that can be showing up on a map, you should add it to [Google My Business](https://www.google.com/business/).

## Best practice

* Enter the complete data regarding the business
* Verify the business' location(s)
* Keep the opening hours accurate
* Manage and respond to reviews
* Be active in adding photos related to the business
* If applicable, add in-store products to the business profile
