# Google Maps

The visibility of a website in the search results can be increased if it also appears in the search engine map.
So if the website belongs to a business or other location that can be showing up on a map, you should add it to [Google My Business](https://www.google.com/business/).

### Best practice

* Add all the important information about the business/website
* Always keep opening hours up to date
* Read and reply to reviews
* Add photos
