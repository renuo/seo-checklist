# URL redirects

Redirects often cause search engine indexing issues and can also lead to some minor loading delays. Google recommends removing or keeping redirects to a minimum. One redirect may be acceptable, particularly if the URL is redirecting from a non-www version to its www version, or vice-versa.

### Best practice

* recommended for SEO:
  * 307, "Moved Permanently"
* NOT recommended for SEO:
  * 301, "Moved Temporarily"
  * Meta Refresh `<http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://example.com/">`
