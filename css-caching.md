# CSS caching
A page should be using caching headers for all CSS resources. Users browsers will check for these headers and, if any, will cache the CSS resources until the specified date (so that it does not keep re-fetching the unchanged file from your server). This speeds up your site the next time returning visitors arrive at your site and require the same CSS resource.
