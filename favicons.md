# Favicons

Favicons are small icons that appear in your browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.
Usually, a favicon is 16 by 16 pixels and stored as an ICO file (gif and png are supported as well, however).
Your site should be using and correctly implementing a favicon. 
This helps brand your site and make it easy for users to navigate to your site among a list of bookmarks.

Tools that you can use to generate favicons for your website:

## Best practice

* Ensure your site has a favicon for each page
* The favicon should have enough contrast ratio
* Ensure that the favicon stays perceptible also when resized really small
* Keep the favicon as simple as possible (no photorealistic icons, max two colours, etc.)
