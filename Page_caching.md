# Page caching

A page cache saves dynamically generated pages and serves the pre-generated (cached) page to reduce server load and site loading time (by avoiding the re-loading and execution of PHP scripts).

## Best practice

* Use server caching.
* Use browser caching: expires headers, cache-control headers.
