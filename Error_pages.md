# Error pages

* Create custom 404 pages: [Google Search Console Help](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93641).
* Use a [404 page analyser](https://websiteadvantage.com.au/404-Error-Handler-Checker#heading) to check it.
* Use a 301 page to redirect users to a new page or website when the old URL is not working anymore check out this useful article from [ahrefs]( https://ahrefs.com/blog/301-redirects/).
* Create custom 401 pages if you have sites which require admin rights.
* Users should never be confused about what happened and where to go next.

## Best practice

* Make sure your 404 page is unique and brings the user back to your homepage (check out our 404 page <https://www.renuo.ch/de/404>)
